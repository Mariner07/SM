# Safety Management Project


 

The role of Augmented Reality in making a safe workplace in teaching, learning, training purpose, planning processes etc. in the context of University of Central Asia. 

 

Introduction: 

 

GOAL 

What are we trying to accomplish? 

In this research paper, we will be discussing and designing a safer workplace with the help of Augmented reality, in context of University of Central Asia, Naryn Campus.
Initially, we will explore the notion of Augmented Reality itself and how it can be used to assist humans in certain way in order to avoid any future hazard and carry out any
task efficiently and safely. Augmented reality is often confused to with virtual reality, but the two terms are totally different in terms of how they work. Virtual reality 
implies a complete experience that does not include the interference of any physical world, and in contrast, Augmented reality provides an experience of both virtual and 
physical world in concurrent. Now, we can use Augmented in reality in certain way, as per the situation now it is quite impossible to work in the office as we have to maintain 
social distancing to avoid any physical contact in fear of getting the virus and work from home is encouraged these days. So, in these situation, we can get help form 
technologies like Augmented reality to carry out the task from miles away physically sitting somewhere else, but be virtually at some other place to have the same experience of 
working at office with the help of augmented reality tools, so that the lives of people will not be at risk and at the same time carrying out the task quite efficiently. 
Augmented reality helps to improves the process from delivering of excellent quality training of the employees or the employers to practical on the sport use of certain items to 
prevent workplace incidents and accidents which might be lethal and hazardous in certain scenarios. For example, for the workers on the job, imagine giving them the power to see 
the manuals without actually being present at the place, get or give the instructions, and tips as they were being given instruction on some type of equipment. The use of 
Augmented reality in classroom while teaching can be one of the big future things to aid students in understanding the concepts quite easily and in a safe environment. Using 
augmented reality in the classroom can turn an ordinary class into an engaging experience. AR technology provides virtual examples and adds gaming elements to support textbook 
materials. As a result, classes become more interactive. AR helps students better remember the information they’ve just learned. So, considering all the things mentioned above, 
we will try to design the workplace or the environment where we can use Augmented reality in certain areas within the UCA’s campus in certain activities to maximize productivity 
and at the same time taking into consideration of the safety of every individuals and avoiding any harmful activities.
